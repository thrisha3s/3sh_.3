Exposing the Truth: Advanced Fake News Detection with NLP üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüì∞

Introduction
In today's digital age, fake news has become a pervasive issue, spreading misinformation rapidly across social media, websites, and news outlets. The consequences of fake news are severe, affecting public opinion, politics, and even global events. This project leverages Advanced Fake News Detection using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to combat the spread of misinformation.

Exposing the Truth is an AI-powered solution designed to identify and classify fake news articles, helping users differentiate between reliable and misleading content. By using sophisticated machine learning models, this project aims to protect individuals and society from the harm caused by fake news.

üîç What You‚Äôll Learn
How to train machine learning models to detect fake news using text classification

Implementing NLP techniques for feature extraction and preprocessing

Evaluating and deploying models for real-time fake news detection

The importance of ethical AI in tackling fake news

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/thrishh.git
cd thrishh
2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary libraries and dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the Model (Optional)
If you want to retrain the model on your own dataset, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This will generate the model.pkl file for use in the app.

4. Run the App
Start the Flask app to interact with the fake news detection system:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to use the application.

üîë Key Concepts
Data Preprocessing: Text data undergoes various preprocessing steps like tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal to convert raw text into a machine-readable format.

Feature Engineering: Key features like term frequency and sentiment analysis are extracted to help the model make accurate predictions.

Model Training: Machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, BERT, and Random Forest, are trained on labeled datasets to identify patterns in fake news.

Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
